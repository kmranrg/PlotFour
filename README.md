# PlotFour


## How to Play??

Plot Four is a two player connection game in which
the players first choose a color and then take turns 
dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column,
six-row vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next
available within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first form a
vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of four of one's
own discs.
